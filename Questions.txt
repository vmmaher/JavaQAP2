1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?
    It took approximately 3 hours to complete the assignment.

2. What online resources you have used?
    I looked up compareTo methods online on w3schools.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems.
    No, I didn't need any help.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask?
    No, I didn't need to.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
    The first and second questions were relatively simple, but I did have some difficulty with understanding the third question. However, a different but similar problem likely wouldn't pose any problems in the future.
